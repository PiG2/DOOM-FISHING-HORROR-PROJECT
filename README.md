# DOOM HORROR FISHING GAME

### This is built using a bastardized version of someone's DOOM python renderer.

Problems:

- Loading a custom WAD
        We need to connect Slade3 to an external node builder like ZDBSP
                > https://zdoom.org/downloads (ZDBSP 1.19)
        Having troubles without using a node builder like ZDBSP. I don't think this is very apparent due to the anitquated nature of how we are choosing to do this. It took hours for me to realize OHHHH you DO have to build the nodes, it's just an entirely separate program üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è

Todo:

        - Add fishing pole
        - Get first map in (hurry pig)
